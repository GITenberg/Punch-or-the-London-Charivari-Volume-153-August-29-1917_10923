<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>Germany is a bankrupt concern, says <i>The Daily Mail</i>. A
denial is expected every hour from Herr MICHAELIS, who is Germany's
Official Deceiver.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Much sympathy is felt in Germany for Admiral VON TIRPITZ, whose
proposed cure in Switzerland is off. His medical adviser has
advised him to take a long sea voyage, but failed to couple with
the advice a few particulars on how to carry it out.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Patrons of the royal theatres in Germany who pay in gold can now
obtain two seats for the price of one. This is not the inducement
it might seem to be. The German who used to buy one ticket and
occupy two seats is almost extinct.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A chicken with four legs and four wings is reported from
Soberton. Did it come from any other place we should receive the
story with suspicion.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"New Labour troubles are brewing," declares <i>The Evening
News</i>. The chief Labour trouble, however, seems to be not
brewing.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>One sportsman, says a news item, has landed seventy-seven pounds
of bream at Wrexham. It may have been sport, but it has all the
earmarks of honest toil.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A man charged with smoking in a munitions factory told the court
he was trying to cure the toothache. A fine was imposed, the Bench
pointing out that the man was lucky not to have lost the tooth
altogether.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>As a means of preserving the memory of hero M.P.s, Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL suggests a name-plate on the back of the seats they had
in the House. We understand that Mr. GINNELL resolutely refuses to
have such a plate on the back of his old seat.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Honour where honour is due. A man named KITE told the Willesden
magistrate that he had joined the Royal Flying Corps, and the
magistrate refrained from being funny.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Light cars are now becoming very popular, says <i>The
Autocar</i>. We understand that they have always been preferred by
pedestrians, who realise that they make only a slight indentation
in the person as compared with the really heavy car.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Whatever else may happen," says a contemporary, "the final
decision as to Stockholm rests with the Government." Our
contemporary is far too modest. A few months ago the final decision
would have rested with the stunt Press.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Portsmouth is to have three M.P.s, we read, under the
Proportional Representation scheme, though it is not known what
Portsmouth has done to deserve this.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Something like a panic was caused in the City the other day when
news got round that no mention of Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL appeared in
a <i>Morning Post</i> leader.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A postwoman charged at Old Street Police Court admitted that she
had swallowed a postal order and a pound Treasury note. Some women
have a remarkable objection to using the ordinary purse.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A woodworm in the timbering of Westminster Hall has been
attacked with a gas-spray by the Board of Works. The little fellow
put up a gallant fight and died bravely defending his third line
trenches against a vastly superior force.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Vienna <i>Neue Freie Presse</i> says that so far
&pound;18,000,000,000 has been spent on the War. But even those who
contend that it might have been more cheaply done admit that the
notice was too short to enable the belligerents to call for
tenders.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>In a Brixton tramway car the other morning Mr. LLOYD GEORGE, it
is announced, had to borrow coppers from a companion to pay his
fare. The most popular explanation is that he had spent all his
money in buying the latest editions of the evening papers.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>According to the Acton magistrate, under new instructions boys
over fourteen must pay their own fines or go to prison, parents
paying the fines for those below that age. This class legislation
is bitterly resented by some of our younger wage-earners, who
intend to insist upon their right to pay for their own
amusements.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>People living next door to a post-office where burglars blew
open the safe thought it was an air raid and went into the cellar.
A suggestion that signals, clearly distinguishable from those used
in air raids, should be used on these occasions, is under
consideration in the right quarter.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The FOOD CONTROLLER has advised the Liverpool Corporation that
vegetable marrows are not fruit. There is a growing belief among
jam manufacturers that Lord RHONDDA'S business ability has been
overrated.</p>

<h3>A HINT.</h3>
<i>Unsuccessful Competitor at the Allotment-holders' Show.</i> "I
AIN'T MAKING ANY COMPLAINT, MR. SMITH. BUT W'EN THE FUST PRIZE FOR
ONIONS GOES TO THE JUDGE'S BROTHER-IN-LAW AND THE FUST PRIZE FOR
MARRERS TO 'IS WIFE'S GRANDFATHER, IT MAKES YER THINK A BIT, THAT'S
ALL."</div>
<hr />
<h3>CALLING A CAB.</h3>
<blockquote class="note">
<p>["But how to get a cab without whistling&mdash;that is the
problem."&mdash;<i>Evening News</i>.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A very good plan is to purchase a camp-stool and sit down in the
Strand until a taxicab breaks down. When you are sure that the
driver is not looking step inside.</p>
<p>Taxi-drivers are human, and if caught young can be made so tame
that they will take fares by the hand.</p>
<p>An excellent plan is to make a noise like a road under repair.
But be careful that the driver does not make a noise like a cab
going over a human body.</p>
<p>The essential thing is to interest the driver in your personal
affairs. If you see a car rushing along stand in the road. When the
cab pulls up, ask the driver if he would like to see your cigarette
pictures.</p>

<h2>A HEAD CASE.</h2>
<p>We were discussing that much discussed question, whether it is
better to be wounded in the leg or in the arm, when young Spilbury
butted in.</p>
<p>"I don't know about legs and arms," he said, "but I know there
are certain advantages in having your head bound up." Spilbury's
own head was bound up, and we all said at once that of course the
head was much the worst place in which to be wounded.</p>
<p>"It may be," said Spilbury. "But what I said was that there are
certain advantages in having your head bound up. That's not quite
the same thing as being wounded in the head. For instance, I wasn't
wounded in the head. I was wounded in the jaw. But they can't
bandage the jaw without bandaging the head, which I have found has
certain advantages."</p>
<p>"I can't see where they come in," said Cotterell, "except so far
as personal appearance goes, of course. I won't say that that
nun-like head-dress doesn't become you. You look almost handsome in
it."</p>
<p>"It is extremely polite of you to say so," said Spilbury, "but I
was not thinking of that. I was thinking of Dulcie."</p>
<p>There was silence for a space, and then Cotterell said, "If you
do not mention her other name, you may tell us about Dulcie."</p>
<p>"I became acquainted with Dulcie" Spilbury began, "or the lady I
will call Dulcie&mdash;for that is not actually her
name&mdash;while we were quartered at a camp somewhere in England.
Friendships ripen quickly in war-time. I was signalling officer,
and perhaps I signalled to Dulcie rather more than I meant. I won't
say I was wholly blameless in the matter."</p>
<p>"I shouldn't," said I.</p>
<p>"I won't," said Spilbury. "After I went out we corresponded. But
after a little I began to see I had perhaps over-estimated my
affection for Dulcie. At the time I was wounded I had owed her a
letter for some time, I remember. When I got back to England I did
not let Dulcie know at once, but after a while she heard where I
was in hospital and came to see me. In the meantime I had met
Daphne."</p>
<p>"This is a highly discreditable story," said Cotterell. "I am
sorry I allowed you to tell it."</p>
<p>"I won't finish it, then," said Spilbury complacently.</p>
<p>"Yes, you must finish it now."</p>
<p>"Well, I didn't quite know what to do about it. I had felt when
we were somewhere in England that Dulcie brought out all that was
best in me. I found now that Daphne brought out still more."</p>
<p>"She must have been a clever girl," I said.</p>
<p>"She was," said Spilbury, "but I saw that if they both tried at
once they might bring out almost too much. I had to act quickly,
for Dulcie was already by my bedside."</p>
<p>"'Well, Reggie,'" she said.</p>
<p>"I looked at her kindly but firmly.</p>
<p>"'I think there is some mistake,' I said. 'I don't remember
having met you.' Then I pointed to my bandaged head, and added, 'I
may have forgotten. My memory isn't very good.'</p>
<p>"Well, she chatted a bit about general subjects, and then
departed. I don't mind saying I felt rather a worm. Also I wasn't
quite sure that Dulcie couldn't bring out more that was good in me
than Daphne, after all. So I thought about it a bit, and then wrote
and said I'd remembered her now, and would she come again to see
me? She wrote back and said she would, and I must congratulate her
as she was just engaged to be married. That was a rotten day, I
remember, because in the afternoon Daphne came and said that she
was engaged to be married too. A perfect epidemic. But that's
beside the point."</p>
<p>"The point was, if I remember rightly," said Cotterell, "that
it's a great advantage to have your head bandaged. Have you quite
proved it?"</p>
<p>"No," said Spilbury thoughtfully. "Now you mention it, I hardly
think I have. But if my story acts as an example and a warning I
shall be satisfied."</p>
<p>So as an example and a warning (though of what or to whom is not
too clear) I have recorded it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>MUSICAL MURMURINGS.</h2>
<h4>(<i>By our Orchestral Expert.</i>)</h4>
<p>The full programme for the season of Promenade Concerts which
opened last Saturday is, as usual, a most interesting document, and
we are of course glad to see that our gallant Allies are so well
represented. But it is the function of the critic to criticise, and
we may be permitted to express a mild regret that our native
school, though by no means excluded, does not make so good a show
as its energy and talents would seem to warrant. Our native
composers are especially noticeable for their wide range of themes,
for the Celtic and Gaelic glamour which they infuse into their
treatment of them, and for their realistic titles. We have drawn up
a list of instrumental works which illustrate these
characteristics, but which are unfortunately conspicuous by their
absence from Sir HENRY WOOD'S scheme. As, however, it is subject to
alteration we are not without the hope that some of them may yet be
included in the list of works to be heard at the Queen's Hall in
the next six weeks.</p>

<h3>A LIFE OF PLEASURE.</h3>
"MOTHER, NURSE PUT ME RIGHT INTO THE VERY COLDEST PART OF THE
SEA."</div>
<hr />
<h2>THE BROWN CART-HORSE.</h2>
<p>"Brain-fag! That's wot we 'orses are suffering from. Ah! there's
bin a deal o' queer things 'appen since they women started on the
farm! I shan't never forget the first time one of them females come
into my stall. The roan pony, wot's got sentimental thro' being
everlasting driven in the governess-cart, sez she was a pretty
young woman. I never noticed nothing 'bout 'er 'cept the pink rose
in 'er button-'ole. I never 'eard tell of a farm 'and with a pink
rose in 'is shirt before. Maybe such carryings on is all right for
they grooms an' kerridge-'orses, but it ain't 'ardly decent for a
respectable farm 'orse. So when this 'ere woman come along I up and
'as a grab at it. D'ye think she'd 'it me? I never 'ad such a shock
in me life, not since I went backwards when the coal-cart tipped!
Lor, lumme! if she didn't catch 'old of me round the neck an' kiss
me! 'Oh, you darlin'!' she said, 'did you want me rose then,
ducky?' I'm a brown 'orse, but I tell you I blushed chestnut that
morning. 'Course the roan pony next door started giggling, and then
she 'ad to go and kiss 'im, and that settled 'is little game.</p>
<p>"Well, then she come along with the collar. I need 'ardly tell
you 'ow often she tried to fix it on the wrong way round. There I
'ad to stand with 'er shoving the blooming thing till I thought my
'ead would 'ave dropped orf. Being a female, it took 'er some time
before she thought of putting the big end of the collar up first,
but when she did I just took and put me 'ead thro' and nipped orf
'er rose. 'If that don't fetch you,' I sez, 'nothink will.' If that
woman 'ad clouted me on the 'ead then, I'd 'ave loved 'er; 'stead
o' which she calls out to 'er pal 'oo was mucking round cleaning
out the stalls with a broom-'andle, 'May!' she sez. 'Oh, do look!'
she sez, 'this 'ere dear 'orse,' she sez, ''as bin and ate my
rose!'</p>
<p>"Well, when we done all the kissing and that, she led me out of
the stall, and I promise you I was a sight! My bridle was over one
eye and my girths 'anging loose. Maybe that was my own fault; when
she started to pull in the straps 'course I blew meself out, same
as any 'orse would, just to give 'er something to pull on. 'Oh
dear!' says the female. 'Poor 'orse, this 'ere girth's too tight!'
Any'ow, when we did get to the 'ayfield she 'ad to fetch a man to
put me into the rake. Well, 'e told her 'ow to go on, and we moves
orf. That wasn't 'arf a journey! Wot with 'er pulling one way an'
pulling another, I got fair mazed. Arter a bit I stopped. ''Ave it
your own way then,' I sez. Next minute I 'eard 'er calling out like
a train whistle to the bailiff, 'oo was passing. 'Smith!' she sez,
'this pore 'orse is tired!' And Smith sez, 'Tired!' 'e sez; ''e's
lazy!' And with that 'e fetched me one. 'All right, my girl,' I
thinks; 'you wait a bit.'</p>
<p>"This 'ere field run past a railway, and when Smith 'ad gone I
seen one of the signals on the line go down. 'That's the ticket!' I
sez, and when the train come by I up and shook me 'ead. The woman
didn't say nothing, so I gives a 'op with all me feet at once.
Still she don't say nothing, and I couldn't feel 'er on the reins,
so I done a few side steps. And then she spoke, and this is wot she
sez: 'Oh!' she sez, 'please don't!' and started crying.</p>
<p>"There's no vice about me, and when she begun 'er game I stopped
mine. You'd 'ardly believe it, but that 'ere woman got down orf
that 'ere rake and she come round to my 'ead and, 'Pore darling,'
she sez, 'was you frightened of the train then?' Me! wot's 'ad me
life in the London docks till I come 'aying 'long of the War.</p>
<p>"Ah! I reckon the roan pony's right: You can't 'ave the larst
word with females!"</p>

<h2>SUAVITER IN MODO.</h2>
<p>Profound stillness reigned in the wardroom of H.M.S.
<i>Sinister</i>, broken only by the low tones of the Paymaster and
the First Lieutenant disputing over the question of proportional
representation and by the snores of the Junior Watchkeeper,
stretched inelegantly on the sofa. The rest of the occupants were
in the coma induced by all-night coaling. Into this haven of quiet
burst the ship's Doctor in a state of exaggerated despair. He
groaned and, sinking into a chair, mopped his forehead
ostentatiously. The disputants ceased their discussion and watched
him intently as though he were some performing animal.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," said the Paymaster presently in tones of sepulchral
gloom, "the neophyte of &AElig;SCULAPIUS, to whose care the
inscrutable wisdom of Providence has entrusted our lives, is being
excruciatingly funny. Number One says it is belated remorse for the
gallant servants of His Majesty whom he has consigned to an
untimely grave."</p>
<p>"Poor jesting fool," said his victim, "little he knows that even
now Heaven has prepared a punishment fitted even to his crimes. I
have seen it&mdash;nay, I have spoken with it."</p>
<p>"Suppose," intervened the Commander, "that you postpone this
contest of wits and let us have your news."</p>
<p>"Certainly, Sir," acquiesced the Doctor. "It's Pay's new
assistant. He's ..." the Doctor paused in search of adequate
expression, "he's here. He is, I fancy, at this moment slapping the
skipper on the back and asking him to have a drink. He called me
'old socks.'" The doctor shuddered. "Then he said he expected this
was some mess; Naval messes were always hot stuff. He wanted to
spin me yarns of his infant excesses, but I choked him off by
telling him he ought to report to the skipper. You'll have to look
after him, Pay. That will give you some honest work for a
change."</p>
<p>It must be confessed that at lunch the newcomer justified the
Doctor's worst forebodings. Afterwards the First Lieutenant and the
Paymaster had an earnest colloquy. Then the latter sought his new
assistant; he found him gloomily turning over the pages of a
six-months-old illustrated paper.</p>
<p>"What do you think of the ship?" he asked cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Rotten slow lot," replied the A.P.; "I tried to make things hum
a bit at lunch and they all sat looking like stuffed owls."</p>
<p>"Ah, you'll find it different this evening after the Commander
has gone. Bad form to tell smoking-room yarns while he's here."</p>
<p>Meanwhile the First Lieutenant visited the Commander in his
cabin.</p>
<p>"Very well," said the latter on parting; "only mind, no
unnecessary violence."</p>
<p>"I understand, Sir. I hope it won't be necessary."</p>
<p>The Assistant Paymaster had no cause to complain of lack of
hilarity at dinner. The most trivial remark was greeted with roars
of merriment. When the KING'S health had been drunk the Commander
pleaded letters and left the ward-room. Instantly a perfect babel
arose. Everyone seemed to be asking everyone else to have a drink.
The newcomer selected a large whisky.</p>
<p>"Wilkes," said the First Lieutenant, "one large whisky, one
dozen soda, one dozen ginger-beer and two large bottles of
lime-juice."</p>
<p>"Large bottles, you blighter!" he yelled after the back of the
astonished marine who went out to fulfil this remarkable order.</p>
<p>"Now," said the Junior Watchkeeper, when all the glasses had
been filled, "I call on Number One for a song." Amid vociferous
applause the First Lieutenant, clasping a huge tumbler of
ginger-beer, rose unsteadily. Without the semblance of a note
anywhere he proceeded to bawl "A frog he would a-wooing go." A
<i>prima donna</i> at the zenith of her fame might have envied his
reception. The Junior Watchkeeper broke half the glasses in the
transports of his enthusiasm. "Come along, Doc," said the singer as
soon as he could make himself heard; "give us a yarn." With the
assistance of his neighbours the Doctor placed one foot on his
chair and the other on the table. "Say, you fellows," he said
thickly, "jolly litl' yarn&mdash;Goblylocks an' Three Bears."</p>
<p>Overcome, apparently, by tender recollections he was silent, and
fixed the walnuts with a dreamy stare.</p>
<p>"Go on, Doc!" "Goldilocks, Goldilocks." "The Doc," said the
Paymaster, "was always a devil for the girls."</p>
<p>"Pay," remonstrated the First Lieutenant sorrowfully, "that's
the third half-penny for swearing this year. You mean that the
Doctor has always evinced a marked partiality for the society of
the gentler sex."</p>
<p>Punctuated at the more exciting points with breathless
exclamations of horror and amazement from his audience, the
Doctor's rendering of the story proved an overwhelming success. As
he painted in vivid periods the scene where Goldilocks was
discovered by all three bears asleep in the little bear's bed, the
First Lieutenant broke down completely and had to be patted and
soothed into a more tranquil frame of mind before the story could
proceed. Then there was a spell of musical chairs, the First
Engineer obliging at the piano, and afterwards giving a tuneful
West-Country folk-song at the Doctor's request. The Junior
Watchkeeper, declaring his inability to remember anything, read
half a column from the "Situations Vacant" portion of <i>The
Times</i>, and amid the ensuing applause slipped quietly from the
room in obedience to an unspoken signal from the First Lieutenant.
After the Second Engineer had given an exhibition of what he
asserted to be an Eskimo tribal dance, the First Lieutenant
addressed the Assistant Paymaster.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg
153]</span>
<p>"Now then, young fellow, it is your turn. D'you want to give us
a yarn?"</p>
<p>But the boy had learned his lesson. "I'm afraid I don't know any
yarns that would interest you, Sir," he said. "If you don't mind I
think I'll turn in."</p>
<p>The First Lieutenant smiled on him with the mature wisdom of
twenty-seven summers. "Quite right, my lad. By the way, you might
look in at the bath-room on the way to your cabin and tell the
Junior Watchkeeper that we shan't want the bath that he is filling
from the cold tap. I'm very glad we shan't."</p>

<h2>A LETTER FROM THE FRONT</h2>
<h3>ON A PURELY DOMESTIC MATTER.</h3>
<p>MY DEAR WIFE,&mdash;Yours to hand of the 10th inst., and
contents, <i>re</i> son, noted. I observe that you are for the
moment satisfied with his progress, and that you feel yourself in a
position to be able to see your way to inform me that he is
beginning to have and express ideas of his own on all subjects. He
shows himself a fine fellow, and you have every reason to be as
happy as it is possible to be in wartime.</p>
<p>By the same post arrived the new uniform from Dover Street,
London, W. You will be glad to hear that Messrs. Blenkinson have
done us proud, managing to carry out your many suggestions without
departing from regulation. They make a fine fellow of me, neat but
not gaudy, striking in appearance without being offensive to the
eye. Once more they too have shown themselves fine fellows. We are
all fine fellows; my dear, you are positively surrounded on all
sides by fine fellows, and it would look as if, given peace, we are
all together going to be as happy as the day is long.</p>
<p>So I thought at first blush; but are we so sure? The separate
ingredients are excellent; there couldn't be a better son than
Robert or better tailors than Messrs. Blenkinson. But how will they
blend? Mind you, I'm not daring to doubt the courtesy and tact of a
single Blenkinson; but these views which son Robert is beginning to
form, where will they lead him ... and us ... and the Blenkinsons?
Again, I'm not suggesting that Robert will ever go to such lengths
in view-forming as to dare to attack such an anciently and
honourably established firm as Messrs. Blenkinson; indeed, I could
almost wish it might fall out that way, and that they and I might
continue, without intervention, upon our present terms of mutual
esteem and entire satisfaction. If things stand so well between us,
while I am but young, claiming no higher rank or standing than that
of Captain (Temp.), how much more must we flourish when I have
risen to those heights to which we know I am bound to reach in my
full maturity? Against such an alliance even the youthful and
vigorous Robert would hurl himself and his criticisms in vain. No,
I foresee a danger more subtle and formidable than that.</p>
<p>Some of the very first views that Robert forms will be on the
subject of clothes. His very desire to be perfectly dressed will
take him to Blenkinsons', and, when he has spent two hours trying
on the very latest, his desire to get me, at any rate, passably
dressed will induce him to say to Mr. Blenkinson, senior: "I say,
can't you do something to stop the governor wearing clothes like
<i>that?</i>"</p>
<p>Blenkinson, having long anticipated and dreaded this, will at
once hasten round to the back with the tape-measure; but Robert
will catch him when he comes round again and say, "I shouldn't have
believed that <i>you</i> would ever consent to make such clothes as
he insists on wearing."</p>
<p>Blenkinson perforce will smile that deferential and conciliatory
smile of his, which seems to say: "We entirely agree with you, Sir,
but it isn't for us to say so."</p>
<p>Robert, blown out with conceit, upon being tacitly corroborated
by Blenkinsons in a matter of taste, will pursue the subject
mercilessly, until his victim is forced into some definite
statement. Looking round to see that he cannot possibly be
overheard, Blenkinson, senior, will be led by his too perfect
courtesy to commit himself. "Well, Sir," he will murmur, "we have
on one or two occasions dared to hint that his cut was rather out
of date, and would he permit us to alter it in some small
particulars? But Sir Reginald" (or shall we make it "the General"?)
"prefers, quite rightly, of course, to decide these things for
himself."</p>
<p>"'Quite rightly' be blowed," Robert will retort. "We know and he
doesn't. Can't you make him understand? You can sometimes get him
to be reasonable, if you stick to him long enough."</p>
<p>Blenkinson will be quite unable to let his old and honoured
customer go entirely undefended or unexcused on so grave an issue.
"We fancy, Sir, that the General" (or shall we say "His Lordship"?)
"understands just as well as we do, Sir, but...."</p>
<p>"But what?" Robert would exclaim, a little exasperated to hear
it suggested in his presence that I understand anything.</p>
<p>Mr. Blenkinson, senior, will rub his chin, wondering very much
whether he is justified in allowing himself to go so far as to hint
at the truth in this instance. "But&mdash;er&mdash;well, Sir," will
be extracted from him at last, "we gather&mdash;er&mdash;we gather,
Sir&mdash;er'm&mdash;her Ladyship insists."</p>
<p>I see Robert's face clear and I hear him say in quite a
different tone, "Oh, I'll soon manage mother for you." And off he
trots home, and in a week or less I have to adopt his ridiculously
ugly, obviously impracticable and damnably uncomfortable
fashions&mdash;tight trousers and high collars, no doubt.</p>
<p>Yes, that's where Robert, and you, with your Robert, are leading
me, confound you both. It will be as bad as that; confound you
both.</p>
<p>"Don't speak like that, even in jest," you'll say brazenly.</p>
<p>"But damme, Mary&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And I certainly will not have my name coupled with that sort of
language, please."</p>
<p>I shall appeal to Robert to bear evidence that I am the injured
party, and not you. Robert of course will stand by you, and you,
worthless woman that you are, will sink your identity and sacrifice
your soul and stand by TIGHT TROUSERS AND HIGH COLLARS.</p>
<p>And I shall get red in the face (and at the back of the
neck).</p>
<p>And in the end I shall have to make good by taking you all out
to the most expensive dinner, theatre and supper
possible&mdash;very nice for you two, no doubt, but what about me
in those infernal trousers and collars?</p>
<p>It will right itself in the end, for I cannot believe your
reason will permanently forsake you, even for that precious nut of
a Robert. Eventually we shall prefer, unanimously you and I, to
slink about the back streets, clothed in our own ideas, rather than
promenade the fashionable parts clothed in Robert's.</p>
<p>Do you say to yourself that that supreme test, the sacrifice of
Piccadilly, Bond Street and the Park, is too much? Don't cry,
darling; it will never be as bad as that. And why? Because,
according to that incredibly stupid young man, Robert, Piccadilly,
Bond Street and the Park will then be the back streets, in which no
decent people, except out-of-date, old-fashioned fogeys like
ourselves, would ever consent to be seen. So it is really myself
who is still alone. Yours, R.</p>
<hr />
<h2>LOVELY WOMAN.</h2>
<p>If the casual gods send inquiring strangers into my camp, let
them (the intruders) be civil, please, or at least be male.
Citizens I can at once wave away with a regretful <i>nescio
vos</i>; foot-officers are decently reserved in their thirst for
knowledge of an essentially Secret Service; but officers'
wives&mdash;</p>
<p>I was growing to like the Royal Gapshire Cyclists (H.D.), my
neighbours in the next field, until last Friday, when they
perpetrated their Grand Athletic Tournament. Quite early in the day
twos and threes of subalterns, with here and there a company
commander, dribbled across with a diffident wish to be shown round
the guns, and round we went. By the ninth tour I was wearying fast
of the cicerone act, and hoping they would not mistake my dutiful
reticence for stuffiness. They <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page155" id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span> had made me free of a
mess that has its points. Then, towards tea-time, She came. The
Major, who brought, introduced Her, apologised (not for bringing
Her) and withdrew. He was due to start the Three-Legged Obstacle
Relay. She, on the other hand, was <i>so</i> interested, and
<i>would</i> I, etc.? Would I not!</p>
<p>"Lovely woman!" thought I. "Fit soil for a romantic seed!
Farewell reserve and half-told truth!" I then proceeded to describe
unto her things unattempted yet in Field, Garrison, or High Angle
Ballistics. Her first question (pointing to the recoil-controlling
gear of No. 2 gun), whether <i>both</i> barrels were fired at once,
gave me a cue priceless and not to be missed. My imagination held
good for full fifteen minutes, and by the time we were ambling back
to the fence I had got on to our new sensitive electrical plant for
registering the sound, height, range, speed and direction of
hostile aircraft. The fluent ease of it intoxicated, and I was
lucky not to mar the whole by working in something crude and trite
about the pilot's name.</p>
<p>She departed, smiling radiant thanks, and I thought no more of
it until this morning, when Post Orderly handed me the following
note:&mdash;</p>
<p>"DEAR SIR,&mdash;It was too kind of you to tell me all about
your guns the other day, and it was too bad of me to let you. I
ought to have mentioned that my husband is <i>the</i> Colonel
Strokes, of the High Angle Ordnance Council. One of his favourite
remarks is that the one woman of his acquaintance who knows more
about artillery than a cow does of mathematics is</p>

<h3>CRICKET.</h3>
<p>There is no truth in the rumour that spectacular cricket is to
be resumed. It is perfectly true that a section of the public who
are devoted to watching the game and cannot understand why, because
the nations happen to be at war, this favourite summer recreation
should be denied them, have been agitating for the Government to
arrange with the War Office to release all first-class cricketers
now in the Forces, so that they may be free to play matches at
home. It is also true that the Government, having refused to do
this, subsequently, in view of the arguments urged by a deputation
of cricket enthusiasts, agreed to do so, since it has always set
its face against any pedantic rigidity of purpose. But none the
less no such matches will be played, for the simple reason that the
cricketers themselves refuse to come back until their job is
finished.</p>

<h2>AN IDEAL MEDICAL BOARD.</h2>
<h3>(<i>A Dream of the Future</i>.)</h3>
<p>I was due to go in front of the local Medical Board next
morning, and I was seeking distraction in the evening paper.
Suddenly my eye was caught by the headlines announcing the transfer
of recruiting arrangements from the Military to the Civil
authorities. This promised to be interesting.</p>
<p>All at once the room grew misty, and when the atmosphere cleared
again I found myself in the open street. Before me was a palatial
building with the words "<i>Medical Board</i>" carved on a marble
slab over the main entrance.</p>
<p>I entered, and was immediately confronted by a liveried janitor
who bowed obsequiously.</p>
<p>"I have come to be medically examined," I explained.</p>
<p>"Yes, Sir," he replied. "Will you be good enough to wait one
moment, Sir, while I settle with your taxi-driver, and then I will
take you to the waiting-room, Sir."</p>
<p>"I have no taxi," I said. "I just walked."</p>
<p>An expression of concern passed across his face.</p>
<p>"Oh, you shouldn't have done that, Sir. The Authorities don't
like it. There is a special fund for such expenses, you know, Sir.
Will you please come this way, Sir?"</p>
<p>I followed him along the corridor, and was shown into a
luxurious apartment overlooking a pleasant garden. The janitor
placed an easy chair in position for me, handed me a copy of
<i>Punch</i>, and brought me a glass of wine and some biscuits.</p>
<p>"Now, Sir, if you will give me your papers I will send them up
to the Board."</p>
<p>I handed the packet to him, and he left the room.</p>
<p>A few minutes later a message-girl entered.</p>
<p>"Are you Mr. Smith?" she inquired.</p>
<p>I confessed that I was, upon which she handed me a sealed
envelope. I opened it, and found a letter and a cheque for five
pounds. The letter ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"SIR,&mdash;The above-named Medical Board regrets its inability
to examine you to-day. As you are no doubt aware, it is contrary to
its rule to examine more than three persons in one day, and an
unusually difficult case, held over from yesterday, has upset all
its arrangements.</p>
<p>"The Board would consider it a favour if you could make it
convenient to call again to-morrow morning at the same time.</p>
<p>"The enclosed cheque is intended to compensate you for the
unnecessary trouble to which you have been put.</p>
<p>"Your obedient Servants &mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>Punctually at the time appointed I again entered the building,
and was met by the same janitor.</p>
<p>"The Board is quite ready for you, Sir," he said. "Will you
please ascend to the dressing-room, Sir?"</p>
<p>He committed me to the care of a lift-girl, who conveyed me to
the second storey. Here I was handed over to a smart valet, who
assisted me to undress in a comfortable little apartment replete
with every convenience.</p>
<p>Having donned a warm dressing-gown, I was conducted to the Board
Room, where I found a dozen of our <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page160" id="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span> greatest Specialists
assembled. The President shook hands and greeted me effusively.
Then I passed in turn from one Doctor to another, each making, with
the utmost delicacy and consideration, a thorough examination of
that part of my anatomy on which he was an acknowledged expert.</p>
<p>When this was over I was invited to retire to the dressing-room
and resume my garments while the Board held a protracted
consultation on my case. On returning to the Board Room I was
provided with a seat, and the President addressed me.</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Smith, we can find nothing constitutionally wrong
with you. But tell me, have you ever had any serious illness?"</p>
<p>I shook my head. I had always been abnormally healthy.</p>
<p>"Think carefully," he urged. "We don't want to pass you as fit
if we can help it."</p>
<p>He seemed so anxious that I felt ashamed to disappoint him.</p>
<p>"Well," I replied, "the only thing I can call to mind is that,
according to my mother, I had a severe teething rash when I was ten
months old."</p>
<p>As I uttered these words the faces of all became suddenly
grave.</p>
<p>"That is quite enough, Mr. Smith," said the President. "You are
given total exemption. You should never have been brought here at
all, but I am sure you will realise that in times of national
emergency mistakes of this nature are bound to occur. If you will
apply to the Cashier on your way out he will give you a draft for
twenty pounds, to reimburse you in some small way for the loss of
your valuable time. Good-bye!"</p>
<p>He held out his hand, but before I could grasp it a mist again
enveloped me, from which I emerged upon the dreadful facts of
life.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;HISTORIAN AND PROPHET.</h3>
<p>A hundred years ago to the very day was JOHN LEECH born. Mr.
Punch came into the world on July 17th, 1841, and was thus
twenty-four years younger. But in spite of any disparity in age the
two great men were made for each other. JOHN LEECH without Mr.
Punch would still have spread delight, for did he not illustrate
those <i>Handley Cross</i> novels which his friend THACKERAY said
he would rather have written than any of his own books? But to
think of Mr. Punch without JOHN LEECH is, as the Irishman said,
unthinkable. From the third volume, when LEECH got really into his
stride, until his lamented early death in 1864, LEECH'S genius was
at the service of his young friend: his quick perceptive kindly
eyes ever vigilant for humorous incident, his ears alert for
humorous sayings, and his hand translating all into pictorial drama
and by a sure and benign instinct seizing always upon the happiest
moment.</p>
<p>His three monumental volumes called <i>Pictures of Life and
Character</i> constitute a truer history of the English people in
the middle of the last century than any author could have composed:
history made gay with laughter, but history none the less. And this
leaves out of account altogether the artist's work as a cartoonist,
where he often exceeded the duty of the historian, and not only
recorded the course of events but actually influenced it.</p>
<p>To influence the course of events was however far from being
this simple gentleman's ambition. What he chiefly wished was to
enable others to share his own enjoyment in the fun and foibles of
a world in which it is better to be cheerful than sad, and, in the
process of passing on his amusement, to earn a sufficient
livelihood to enable him to pay his way and now and then be free to
follow the hounds.</p>
<p>All these praises he would probably wish unsaid, so modest and
unassuming was he. Let us therefore stop and merely draw attention
to the two pages of his drawings which follow, each of which shows
JOHN LEECH in the light of a prophet.</p>

<h3>BILLETING AND COOING.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>(The happy ending.)</i></p>
<p><i>Captain Rymill</i> . . MR. DENNIS EADIE.</p>
<p><i>Betty Taradine</i> . . MISS IRIS HOEY.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Betty Taradine</i> is billeting at her pretty manor-house a
nice vague Colonel. The Vicar's sister disapproves, because
<i>Betty</i> is a grass-widow, and <i>Penelope</i>, the
all-but-flapper, an insufficient chaperone. She expresses her
disapproval with a hardy insolence which must be rare with vicars'
sisters in these emancipated times. Naturally when you have a great
deal of palaver about <i>Betty's</i> husband having deserted her
two years ago after a serious tiff, and no word spoken or written
since, you rightly guess that the expected new Adjutant, <i>Captain
Rymill</i>, will be none other than the missing man. But you
probably don't guess that <i>Betty</i>, to spoof the Church and
keep the <i>Colonel</i>, has decided to kill her husband by faked
telegram. So you have a distinctly intriguing theme, which Miss
TENNYSON JESSE and Captain HARWOOD handle with very considerable
adroitness and embroider with many really sparkling and
laughter-compelling lines.</p>
<p>I should like to ask the pleasant authors some questions. How is
it that the infinitely susceptible Colonel who loves
<i>Penelope</i>, but is so overcome by the pseudo-sorrowing
<i>Betty</i> that he is afraid of "saying so much more than he
means," and appeals to his invaluable Adjutant for help&mdash;how
is it he survived a bachelor till fifty? And how did <i>Betty</i>,
with her abysmal ignorance of pass-book lore, manage to postpone
her financial catastrophe for two whole years? And how do they
suppose so popular and personable man as <i>Taradine</i> could come
back to England under an assumed name without a number of highly
inconvenient questions being asked? More seriously, I would ask if
they really expect us to believe in the reconciliation on so deep a
note of this nice butterfly and this callous husband, who never
intended, but for the War, to come back from his big-game shooting,
and who took no pains to arrange suitable guidance (there was a
lawyer vaguely mentioned but he seems to have been singularly
unobtrusive) for the obviously incompetent spouse whom he professes
still to love? I am afraid it will not do. The one real point of
weakness in the presentation was that Mr. EADIE could not modulate
from the key of agreeable flippancy in which the comedy as a whole
was set into that of the solemnly sentimental coda. Thus was the
artistic unity of a pleasant trifle destroyed.</p>
<p>Mr. DAWSON MILWARD'S clever careful method made the
<i>Colonel</i> a very live and plausible figure. Some of his
intimate touches were exceedingly adroit. The authors deserve a
fair share of the credit. Indeed there was throughout a suggestion
of clever characterisation conspicuously above the average of this
<i>genre</i>. <i>Penelope</i> was an excellently developed part,
rendered with unexpectedly mature skill by Miss STELLA JESSE. The
<i>Vicar</i> promised at first to be a new type, but the authors
seemed to have lost interest in him half-way, and not even Mr.
LAWRENCE HANRAY'S skill and restraint could quite save him. I rate
Mr. EADIE as an actor too high to be much amused by him in
obviously EADIE parts. "A man's reach must exceed his grasp." I
think it just to Miss HOEY to say that she seemed a little
handicapped by efforts of memory, a condition which will duly
disappear and leave her charm to assert itself. Mr. GEORGE HOWARD
was quite admirable as a Scots bank manager; Miss BLANCHE STANLEY,
a really sound combination of essential good-nature and wounded
dignity as a cook on the verge of giving notice. Miss GERTRUDE
STERROLL tackled a vicaress of the Mid-Victorian era (authors'
responsibility this) with a courage which deserves both praise and
sympathy.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>
<p>I foresee the appearance, during the next few years, of many
regimental handbooks that will record the history at this present
visibly and gloriously in the making. One such has already reached
me, a second edition of <i>A Brief History of the King's Royal
Rifle Corps</i> (WARREN), compiled and edited by Lieut.-General Sir
EDWARD HUTTON, K.C.B. It is a book to be bought and treasured by
many to whom the record of a fine and famous regiment has become in
these last years doubly precious. The moment of its appearance is
indeed excellently opportune, from the fact that, in the first
place, the K.R.R. was recruited from our brothers across the
Atlantic, the 60th Royal Americans (as they were then) having been
raised, in 1756, from the colonists in the Eastern States, with a
view to retrieving the recent disaster to General BRADDOCK'S
troops, and to provide a force that could meet the French and
Indians upon equal terms. Thus the Regiment, which its historian
modestly calls a typical unit of the British Army, is in its origin
another link between the two great English-speaking allies of
to-day. It has a record, certainly second to none, from Quebec to
Ypres&mdash;one that splendidly bears out the words, themselves
ringing like steel, of its motto, <i>Celer et Audax.</i> I should
add that all profits from the sale of the book will go to "The
Ladies' Guild of the King's Royal Rifle Corps." Friends past and
present will no doubt see to it that these profits are
considerable.</p>

<p>In <i>The Immortal Gamble</i> (A. AND C. BLACK), by A.T. STEWART
and C.J. PESHALL, the Acting Commander and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span>
Chaplain of <i>H.M.S. Cornwallis</i> describe the part taken by
their ship and its gallant complement in the bombardment of
Gallipoli and the subsequent landings down to the final evacuation.
The account is clear, concise, unemotional, and uncontroversial. As
a glimpse rather than a survey of the Dardanelles campaign it
strengthens our faith in the spirit of the race without hopelessly
undermining our confidence in its intelligence. Beyond the fact
that it records deeds of brave men the book has no mission, and its
cheerful detachment might not, in the absence of sterner
chronicles, be salutary. But as long as there are enough
Commissions to publish scathing reports on this or that phase of
national ineptitude it is not the publishers' business to provide
cathartics for the fatted soul of a self-satisfied people. As the
passing of time obliterates the futilities and burnishes the
heroisms of the noblest and most forlorn adventure in the history
of the race, <i>The Immortal Gamble</i> will find a just place
among the simple chronicles of courage which the War is storing up
for the inspiration of the generations to come.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>I fancy that of late the cinema has somewhat departed from its
life-long preoccupation with the cow-boy, otherwise, I should have
little hesitation in predicting a great future on the film for
<i>Naomi of the Mountains</i> (CASSELL). For this very stirring
drama of the wilder West is so packed with what I can't resist
calling "reelism" that it is almost impossible to think of it
otherwise than in terms of the screen. It is concerned with the
wooing, by two contrasted suitors, of <i>Naomi</i>, herself more or
less a child of nature, who dwelt in the back-of-beyond with her
old, fanatic and extremely unpleasant father. But, though the
action is of the breathless type that we have come to expect from
such a setting, there is far more character and serious observation
than you would be prepared to find. Mr. CHRISTOPHER CULLEY has
drawn a real woman, and at least two human and well-observed men. I
will not give you in detail the varied course of <i>Naomi's</i>
romance, which ends in a perfect orgy of battle, with sheriffs and
shooting, redskins and revolvers&mdash;in short, all the effects
that Mr. HAWTREY not long ago so successfully illustrated on the
stage. To sum up, I should describe <i>Naomi of the Mountains</i>
as melodrama with a difference&mdash;the difference residing in its
clever character-drawing and some touches of genuine emotion which
lift it above the ordinary. And this from one to whom the Wild West
in fiction has long been a weariness is something more than tepid
praise.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Sir CHARLES WALDSTEIN, author of the thoughtful
<i>Aristodemocracy</i>, is a thinker with an internationalist mind.
But pray don't think he's not a whole-hogger about the War. In
<i>What Germany is Fighting For</i> (LONGMANS) he analyses the
Germans' statement of their war-aims and does good service by
presenting an excellent translation, with comment and epilogue, of
the famous manifesto of "The Six Associations," and the
"Independent Committee for a German Peace." It is an insolent,
humourless, immoral document. Anything like it published in England
would be laughed out of court by Englishmen. It is difficult to
keep one's temper when one reads all this nauseating stuff about
the little German lamb being threatened by the wolf, England (or
Russia or France, as best suits the current paragraph), and
Germany's fine solicitude for the freedom of the seas. It is no
disrespect to Sir CHARLES WALDSTEIN that his acute and
dispassionate comment is not so forcible an argument to hold us
unflinchingly to the essence of our task as any page of the
manifesto itself. The German, with all his craft, has an almost
unlimited capacity for giving himself away. It would seem that,
after all, humour <i>is</i> the best gift of the gods.... Our
commentator ends with an epigram to the general effect that "until
they adopt, in common with us, the ideal of the Gentleman, in
contradistinction to that of the Superman," we must continue to
strafe them in war or peace. His book constitutes an important War
document.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>If I had been compelled to nominate an author to write a book
called <i>The Gossip Shop</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) I should have
selected Mrs. J.E. BUCKROSE without a moment's hesitation. So I
ought to be happy. Anything more soothing to tired nerves than the
tittle-tattle of these Wendlebury old ladies it is impossible to
imagine. And to add to the lullaby we are given an ancient
cab-horse called <i>Griselda</i>, who with a flick of her tail
seems to render the atmosphere even more calm and serene. Then
there is a love-story which, in spite of misunderstandings, is
never really perturbing, and&mdash;as a spice&mdash;a fortune
telling lady who in such respectable society is as near to being
naughty as doesn't matter. Small beer? Perhaps. But if you want to
get away from the War and rumours of it, I advise you to take a
draught of this tranquillizing potion.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
